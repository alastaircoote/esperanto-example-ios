# Esperanto Example: iOS

This is a really simple example of using [Esperanto](https://github.com/alastaircoote/esperanto) on iOS. Right now it's really not impressive at all becuase it looks exactly like iOS's existing JavaScriptCore bindings. You just have to trust me that it'll be more interesting in the future (and the API will look very different)

## How do I run it?

Esperanto.framework is embedded in the project as a fat library so you all you should need to do is clone and run. Fingers crossed?
